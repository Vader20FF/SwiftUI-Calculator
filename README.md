# SwiftUI-Calculator
An iPhone calculator app recreated in SwiftUI from the scratch as my first app.

The layout and color of this app is very similar to iPhone stock calculator app hovewer there is some additional functionality like:
- being able to see not only the result but also the components of calculations
- being able to use bigger than 9-digits numbers thanks to the Scroll Views


List of things I have learnt during the work on this app:
- How to use ZStack, VStack, HStack, ScrollViews, Texts how to adjust them in size depending on the device (GeometryReader)
- How to make an animation when the tap gesture occurs
- MVVM (how to divide the whole code into the model, view, model-view parts and have every one of the in sync with each other
- Difference beetwen struct and class
- PropertyWrappers such as @Published, @ObservedObject in connection with MVVM
- Setting up different icon styles and sizes depending on the device
- Adding different color sets
